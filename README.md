# SvelteCodeMirror6

This is a test Svelte application to work on creating a CodeMirror 6 component for Svelte.

First, install the needed libraries:

```sh 
npm i 
```

To compile the project, type:

```sh
npm run build
```

To run a development server for the project, type:

```sh 
npm run dev 
```

Afterwards, you can go into the public directory and launch it with NW.js:

```sh
cd public
nwjs .
```

This assumes you have an alias for `nwjs` to point to NW.js on your system.
